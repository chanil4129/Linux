The Way that can b told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is the eternal name.
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Therefore let there always be non-being,
    so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
    so we may see their outcome,
The two are the same,
But After they are produced,
    they have different names.
